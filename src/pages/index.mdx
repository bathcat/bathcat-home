Hello. I'm Eric McMullen. I like software: making it, using it, talking about it.

I still ocassionally do open source projects and staff augmentation. 
But mostly I consult and train on a variety of technologies, including--

- **Languages**: Typescript, Javascript, C#, Python, F#
- **Platforms**: Node, .NET
- **UI Frameworks**: React, React Native, Svelte, Angular
- **RDBMS**: SQL Server

So check out my projects on [Github](https://github.com/bathcat) and reach out if you think I can help.

But AI tools have changed my approach. Things like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
and [Replit](https://replit.com/) have convinced me that the practice of software engineering will
change a lot in the next few years. So recently I spend more time consulting with teams on how
to use AI tools to make better software faster.
