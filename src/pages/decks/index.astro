<Info title={'Decks'} description={'Slide decks'} class=''>
  <p>
    These are slide decks for various workshops and talks I've given. Expect
    more to appear over the next couple weeks.  If you're
    looking for a specific deck and it's not here yet, feel free to nag me.

    After playing with <a href='https://revealjs.com/'>Reveal.js</a>, 
    <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle">Spectacle</a>, 
    and <a href="https://sli.dev/">Sli.dev</a>, I've settled on just rolling my 
    own. It's still got a few warts, so be patient about that too.
