Security isn't something you add at the end. This seminar teaches you how to build secure applications with Angular and .NET from the ground up. Through hands-on demos and exercises, you'll learn to identify common vulnerabilities, implement effective mitigations, and make informed trade-offs between security, usability, and development speed.

We cover the full stack: browser security policies, authentication patterns with OAuth and JWT, authorization strategies, input validation, and secure API design. Each topic includes real-world examples of what goes wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it. You'll leave with practical knowledge you can apply immediately to your projects.

### Objectives
Upon completion of this seminar, you will be able to:
* Identify and mitigate common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks
* Implement secure authentication using OAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT tokens
* Apply browser security features like CSP, CORS, and SameSite cookies
* Design authorization strategies that balance security with maintainability
* Validate and sanitize user input effectively across frontend and backend
* Make informed security trade-offs appropriate to your application's risk profile
