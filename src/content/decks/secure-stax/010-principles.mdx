> it's __almost unbounded how terrible something could be__.

### [Samy (2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm))
* First major XSS worm attack on MySpace
* Infected over 1 million users in 20 hours
* Combined failures:
  - MySpace didn't sanitize HTML input
  - Browsers lacked CSP and modern protections
* Creator: Samy Kamkar, arrested under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act


---

### [Stuxnet (2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)
* State-sponsored cyberweapon targeting Iranian nuclear facilities
* Used [4 zero-day exploits](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/) and stolen certificates
* Combined failures:
  - Exploited air-gapped network via USB
  - Targeted centrifuges via PLCs
  - Manipulated monitoring systems to hide sabotage

---

### [Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/jaguar-land-rover-attack-british-economy-25-billion/803491/) (2025)
* Criminal gang attack
  - $2.5 billion in damages
  - Production halted for weeks
* Combined failures:
  - Jira authentication bypass
  - Credential harvesting from exposed logs
  - Possible vishing and Cisco vulnerabilities

---

### Common Themes
* Attacks:
  - Exploit multiple vulnerabilities in sequence
  - Range from individuals to state actors to criminal enterprises
* Defense requires layered security approach
* *Good news*: Single failures are rarely catastrophic




---


## Taxonomies

---

### [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
* Standard for **executive** communication
* Organized by prevalence and impact
* **Useful for** getting budget and attention
* **Less useful for**
  - Day-to-day development
  - Code review checklists
  - Teaching security patterns

---

### OWASP Top 10 List
{/* TODO: Update to 2025 */}
1. [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
2. [Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
3. [Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
4. [Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)
5. [Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

Etc, etc, etc.

---

### Categories Are Tools
* _Categories are made for man, not man for categories_
* Different taxonomies serve different purposes:
  - Understanding attacker behavior
  - Assigning responsibility
  - Executive reporting
  - Industry communication

---

### Taxonomy: What Attackers Want

<figure class='bc-figure-hero-diagram'>

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Attacker Goals))
    Data Theft
      SQL injection
      Path traversal
      IDOR attacks
      API enumeration
    Account Takeover
      Session hijacking
      CSRF
      Weak passwords
      Credential stuffing
    System Control
      Command injection
      Deserialization
      File upload exploits
      SSRF
    Disruption
      DoS and DDoS
      Resource exhaustion
      ReDoS
      Database locks
    Reconnaissance
      Information disclosure
      Error messages
      Exposed endpoints
      Version fingerprinting
```
</figure>
---

### Taxonomy: Who Gets Yelled At

<figure class='bc-figure-hero-diagram'>

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Security Failures))
    Architect
      Passwords in plain text
      No encryption at rest
      Homebrew crypto
      Missing authentication
    Engineer
      SQL injection
      XSS vulnerabilities
      Path traversal
      CSRF holes
    DevOps
      Config files in production
      Default credentials
      Debug mode enabled
      Secrets in source control
    Operations
      Ignore failed login alerts
      Miss SQL injection patterns
      No rate limiting response
      Unpatched dependencies

```
</figure>

---

### Use the Right Tool
* **In threat modeling**: What attackers want
* **In incident response**: Who gets yelled at
* **In compliance meetings**: OWASP Top 10
* **In code review**: Technical mechanisms (SQL injection, XSS)
* **In architecture review**: Design patterns and principles
* Don't let any single taxonomy constrain your thinking

## Mindset


---

### Overview
1. Not Binary
1. Relative
1. Process


---

### Security is Not Binary
#### [Gene Spafford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Spafford):
<figure class='bc-framed-image bc-figure-float' style='width:25%;height:auto;'>
![Gene Spafford](./assets/Gene-spafford.jpg)
</figure>


> The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, 
> cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room 
> with armed guards - and even then I have my doubts. 


---

### Security is relative
* There's no door that the NSA can't get in, but that doesn't matter. 
* (Hereafter referred to as a skilled and determined hacker.) 
* But even with those resources, it's not worth the money.


---

### Surface Area vs Blast Radius
* **Surface Area**: What can be attacked
  - Public APIs
  - User input fields
  - Third-party dependencies
  - Exposed ports and services
* **Blast Radius**: Damage when something fails
  - Single user vs entire database
  - One service vs entire infrastructure

---

### Minimize Both
* **Reduce Surface Area**
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Remove unused endpoints
  - Limit exposed functionality
* **Contain Blast Radius**
  - Database connection with minimal permissions
  - Separate read/write databases
  - Network segmentation

---

### Bear Joke 
<figure class='bc-figure-float' style='width:25%;height:auto;bottom:0;'>
![Bear Safety](./assets/bear_safety.jpg)
</figure>

---

### Security is a Feature
* It's just for a long time, no one was very articulate
* They just say, it should 'be secure'
* Think about your risk profile and risk tolerance


---

### Security Needs Tickets
* If security is a feature, it needs:
  - Requirements
  - Tracking
  - Prioritization
  - Definition of done
* Checklists map naturally to Jira tickets
* Makes security work visible and measurable
* Easier to allocate time and resources

---

### Alignment is Hard
#### [Mark Magliocco:](https://blog.sonatype.com/beyond-npm-audit)
<br/>

> Agreement is easy... alignment is hard. When I ask my wife if she wants dinner,
> she quickly says okay-- the trouble starts when I ask where we should go.


---

### Security Should be Redundant
<figure class='bc-figure-float' style='width:25%;height:auto;bottom:0;'>
![Motte and Bailey](./assets/motte_and_bailey.jpg)
</figure>


* Defence in depth
* Like a [Motte-and-bailey castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_castle)
* Example: 
  * Secure your identity database
  * Hash and salt passwords


---

### Stand on the shoulders of giants
* Don't roll your own stuff
* Think hard before adopting non-mainstream stuff (e.g. Choose Vue over Elm (or whatever))
* Avoid dependencies. If you don't need dancing bunnies, or whatever, maybe roll your own.
* Follow best-practices



---

### Think Like a Practitioner
* You have a responsibility to your users
* Their data, their accounts, their trust
* Like a doctor: first, do no harm
* Security breaches hurt real people
* Take it seriously even when management doesn't


---






## Basicist Rules for Web Apps


---

### Think about __Trust__
* Can you trust the integrity an HTTP request?
* Answer: No
* What about internally-facing services?
* Also: No


---

### Don't Mix Streams

* An entire class of vulnerabilities comes from mixing superficially similar text-like data:
  - SQL Injection: mixing SQL code with user data
  - XSS: mixing HTML/JavaScript with user content
  - Command Injection: mixing shell commands with parameters
  - Path Traversal: mixing file paths with user input
  - LDAP Injection: mixing LDAP queries with user data
* Analogy: Tap water and flood water look similar, but you don't want them in the same glass

---

### The String Problem
* Everything looks like a string
* But a file path is not semantically the same as a user bio
* And HTML is not semantically the same as plain text
* Treating them all as strings invites confusion
* This confusion creates vulnerabilities

---

### Recipe: Value Objects & Branded Types
* Primitive obsession: treating everything as strings
* Problem: string concatenation works on anything
  - Concatenate two dates? Meaningless
  - Concatenate file paths? Path traversal
  - Concatenate HTML fragments? XSS
* Solution: Make the type system help you
* If semantically different, make them different types

---

### [Vogen](https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen)
* Code generator for generating value objects

```csharp title='SanitizedString.cs'
using Vogen;

[ValueObject<string>()]
public partial struct SanitizedString{}
```

```csharp title='UserProfile.cs'
public sealed record UserProfile
{
  public Guid Id { get; init; }
  public string Name { get; init; }
  public string Email { get; init; }
  public SanitizedString Bio { get; init; }
}
```

Now you can't accidentally mix sanitized and unsanitized strings

---

### Trusted Types in the Browser
* W3C standard applying same principle to JavaScript
* Prevents strings from being used as HTML/URLs/Scripts
* Requires explicit conversion through sanitization
* Forces you to be intentional about trust boundaries



---

### Validate Input
> **Input validation** is the process of ensuring input data is consistent with application expectations. Data that falls outside of an expected set of values can cause our application to yield unexpected results, for example violating business logic, triggering faults, and even allowing an attacker to take control of resources or the application itself. 


---

### Never Trust Input
* When building a client, assume the server is compromised
* Building an API, assume you're talking to a hacker


---

### Bad Input Validation Enables
* Cross Site Scripting
* SQL Injection
* Path Traversal


---

### Encode HTML
* HTML is a very, very permissive format
* Browsers try their best to render the content, even if it is malformed


---

### Bind Parameters for Database Queries
* **Don't** concatenate strings
* Use a prepared statement
  e.g. [SqlCommand](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand)
* Better yet [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)


---

### Protect Data in Transit
* SSL Everywhere


---

### Follow Checklists
* OWASP Cheat Sheet Series: cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
* Translates directly to actionable work items
* Each checklist item becomes a ticket
* Makes security auditable and trackable


---

### Security Theater
* Some practices have questionable efficacy
  - Password expiration policies
  - Complex PIN requirements
  - Security questions
* But they're still useful:
  - Might actually help in ways we don't understand
  - Industry standard for responsible organizations
  - Hard to defend deviation during a breach

---

### The Rain Dance Problem
* Even when people suspect rain dances are ineffectual
* The person in charge can't cancel them
* Because droughts actually happen
* And when the drought comes, it's already a hard conversation
* Without having to explain why you stopped doing what everyone else does
* Do the industry-standard minimum, then add real security on top
