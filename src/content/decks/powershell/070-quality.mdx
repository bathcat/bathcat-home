# Quality

---

### Goals

1. Name 2 things banned in strict mode
1. Explain how to mock a cmdlet using Pester
1. Name 2 unit testing best-practices

---

## Sloppy & Strict

---

### Preface

- Pure Powershell lets you screw up silently
- Best practices
  - Add your own guardrails
  - Fail early

---

### Motivation

#### This doesn't work, but there's no error

```powershell
function Get-Message{
  param(
    [string]$Path
  )
  return "Here is your path: $File"
}

Get-Message c:/temp

```

#### (In sloppy mode, that is.)

---

### About Strict Mode

- Strict mode changes semantics to avoid common potential errors

  - Throws more exceptions instead of failing silently
  - Disallows certain constructs

- Forbids
  - Using uninitialized variables
  - Referencing to non-existent properties
  - Referencing invalid index in an array
  - Improper function syntax

---

### Example

#### Now my script fails early

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest

function Get-Message{
  param(
    [string]$Path
  )
  return "Here is your path: $File"
}

Get-Message c:/temp

```

---

### Advice

- Always be strict
- **Don't** use `-Version Latest` in production

---

## Lint Extravaganza

---

### Overview

- Linting is static code analysis

- Advantages:

  - Catch possible errors
  - Enforce consistent style
  - Automatically fix problems

- Disadvantages:
  - Irritating and overbearing out of the box
  - Tools are tempermental

---

### [ScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)

- Current standard for Powershell
- Plays well with VSCode

---

### Usage

#### Command

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ./labs -Recurse -Settings ./PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 -ReportSummary
```

#### Output

```

12 rule violations found.    Severity distribution:  Error = 0, Warning = 10, Information = 2

```

### Auto-Fixing Problems

- Tries to fix:

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ./labs `
  -Recurse `
  -Settings ./PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 `
  -Fix
```

---

### Linting Best Practices

1. Lint automatically-- in the IDE and CI builds
1. Lint errors fail the build
1. Automatically and transparently fix minor style issues, e.g. tabs v spaces
1. Use lint warnings judiciously--

- They add visual clutter, distracting from actual problems
- They’re often ignored anyway

---

## Using Pester

---

### Definitions

> **Unit test**: low-level test case written in the same language as the
> production code, which directly access its objects and members.

- Unit testing is surprisingly controversial
- Probably because it’s hard to do well
- Think of testing as a skill-- like SQL

---

### Common Complaints

- Time to write
- Time to maintain
- Tests are worthless if they don’t get run

---

### Reasons to Test

1. Catch bugs - Especially important without static typing
1. Refactor with confidence
1. Living documentation
1. **_Encourage good design_**

---

### Especially with Dynamic Typing

- Typed languages are better

  - [TypeScript eliminates 38% of bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/aofcik/38_of_bugs_at_airbnb_could_have_been_prevented_by/)

- Tests are especially important in Powershell
  - No compile-time help
  - No expressivess through the type

---

### About [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester)

- Industry standard
- Easy
- Includes a mock framework too!

---

### Big Four

#### Four most important functions:

- **`Describe`** encapsulates a test suite
- **`It`** creates a ‘spec’, does the actual work of testing
- **`Should`** asserts expected behavior
- **`Mock`** fakes out dependencies

---

### Example

```powershell
BeforeAll {
   Import-Module -Force $PSCommandPath.Replace('.Tests.ps1', '.ps1')
}
Describe 'Get-Power' {

   It 'Should be 4 for 2**2' {
      Get-Power 2 2 | Should -Be 4
   }

   It 'Should be 0 for 0**0' {
      Get-Power 0 0 | Should -Be 0
   }

}
```

---

### Idiom: Arrange, Act, Assert

#### Organize a spec--aka test function-- into three sections:

1. **Arrange** all necessary preconditions, inputs
1. **Act** on the functionality under test
1. **Assert** that the results are as expected

---

### Dealing With Exceptions

```powershell
Describe 'Get-Quotient' {

   It 'Should be 1 for 2/2' {
      Get-Quotient 2 2 | Should -Be 1
   }

   It 'Should throw on 1/0' {
      { Get-Quotient 1 0 } | Should -Throw
   }

}

```

---

### Dealing with Dependencies

- Creating a double is often necessary to avoid IO
  - Double object stands in for a dependency
- Doubles come in flavors:
  - A mock verifies behaviour based on expectations
  - A stub just sits there

---

### Mocking Dependencies

#### Cmdlet

```powershell
function Restart-Themes {
   Stop-Service 'Themes'
   Start-Service 'Themes'
}
```

#### Test

```powershell
Describe 'Restart-Themes' {
   It 'Should call Stop-Service and Start-Service' {
      Mock Stop-Service {} -Verifiable
      Mock Start-Service {} -Verifiable

      Restart-Themes
      Should -InvokeVerifiable
   }
}
```

---

### Setting up State

- These things:
  - beforeEach
  - beforeAll
  - afterEach
  - afterAll
- Suggest tight-coupling
- **Best practice:** Use a pure function wherever possible. They’re easier to test, since there’s no state to set up, and harder to screw up.

---

## Best Practices

---

### Unbreakable Spec Rules

1. **No I/O**

- No database
- No disc
- No network

2. **Test 1 thing**

- High cohesion
- Ideally a pure function

3. **Run fast**

- Well under 1s

---

### Don’t Test Stupid Stuff

- Getters and Setters for instance
- The framework you’re working with
- Browser/language behavior

---

### Test from Day 0

- Good unit testing is hard to add to existing, non-tested code
- Estimates include time to build tests
- Consider a document called “Done is...”

---

### TDD & YPP

#### Test Driven Development encourages you to write tests first

1. Stub-out the feature you’re building (Tests pass)
1. Write a test for the stubbed-out feature (New test fails)
1. Implement your new feature. You’re done when the test pass.

#### Do what works for you

---

### My favorite thing: Bug and tests

- When you get a bug, create a test that exposes the bad behavior
  - i.e. before you try to fix anything you should have a failing test
- Idea is: bugs in the wild mean your unit tests failed.

---

### Build Tests into Processes

#### Tests should:

- **Always pass** A failing test should be the same as a broken build
- **Run automatically** Build it into your process

---

### Metric: Coverage

#### The 2 unit test metrics that matter:

- **Coverage** - Usually it’s blocks of code, rather than lines
- **Coverage over time** - Should be going up

#### Coverage goals are arbitrary:

- Even 100% coverage never exercises all permutations
- But set a coverage goal - Maybe 40-60%
- Think of it like your 5 servings of fruits and vegetables

---

### Metric: Execution time

- Run tests asynchronously where possible
- Set an upper limit on per-test execution time
  - Encourages tightly-focused unit tests
  - Ensures the entire suite runs fast, which means the entire suite gets run.

---

### Lab: Pester Golf

- Read instructions: $/labs/pester-golf/README.md
- Build the applications starting with 'startingpoint'
