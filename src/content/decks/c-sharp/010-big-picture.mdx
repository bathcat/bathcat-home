### Common Complaints (Apparently)

* **Verbosity**: [C# can be wordy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-style-rules)
  - Explicit type declarations
  - Boilerplate in older versions
* **Null Handling**: [NullReferenceException](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception) is common
  - Nullable reference types help but are opt-in
* **Async/Await**: [Callback hell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/) in older code
  - Better now with async/await
* **Package Management**: [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) ecosystem can be complex
  - Version conflicts
  - Package restore issues

---

### My Own Personal Complaints

* **No Algebraic Data Types**
  - [Discriminated unions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions) would be nice
  - [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) is limited
* **Type System**
  - No [structural typing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html) like TypeScript
  - Nominal typing everywhere
* **Modern Features**
  - [Records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record) are a start
  - No pipe/composition operators
  - No immutable collections

---

### Compared with VB

* **Syntax**: More concise (and more cryptic)
  - Curly braces instead of `End` statements
  - Semicolons required
  - Case-sensitive
* **Modern Features**: [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching), [records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record)
* **Community**: Larger ecosystem, more resources
* **Future**: Primary focus of .NET development

## History

---

### Motivations Behind .NET
* Unify disparate Windows programming models
* Create platform-independent [runtime environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr)
* Simplify enterprise application development
* Provide garbage collection and memory safety
* Support multiple programming languages on same platform
* Enable component-based development
* Respond to Java's cross-platform success

---

### Motivations Behind C#
* Combine C++ power with Visual Basic productivity
* Create a [truly object-oriented language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/) from the ground up
* Avoid C++'s complexity and unsafe memory management
* Provide a language optimized for the CLR
* Offer modern features like garbage collection and type safety
* Enable rapid application development with elegant syntax
* Balance performance needs with developer productivity

---

### What's the CLR?
* [Common Language Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) - virtual execution environment
* Code compiles to IL (Intermediate Language), not native binary
* Key advantages over direct binary compilation:
  - Platform independence (write once, run anywhere)
  - Language interoperability (C#, VB, F# work together)
  - Automatic memory management (garbage collection)
  - Enhanced security (type safety, code verification)
* Just-in-time (JIT) compilation optimizes for specific hardware
* Managed execution environment handles memory and exceptions
* Runtime services like reflection and dynamic loading

---

### Modern C#
* Evolved from purely OOP to [multi-paradigm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
* Added significant functional programming features:
  - Pattern matching
  - [Expression-bodied members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members)
  - [Records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record) for immutable data
  - [Local functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions)
* Modern features focus on developer productivity:
  - [Null reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references)
  - [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) and [deconstruction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/deconstruct)


---

### Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Compilation
* [Compiles IL to native code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/) at build time
* Perfect for containerized applications:
  - Faster startup for short-lived instances
  - Smaller deployment size
* Key tradeoff: startup speed vs flexibility
* Limitations: restricted reflection and dynamic code

---


## IL

---

### Overview
* [IL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code) is .NET's platform-independent bytecode
* C# compiles to IL, not machine code
* Key features:
  - [Stack-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code#stack-based-execution)
  - [Type-safe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code#type-safety)
  - [Self-describing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code#metadata)
* [JIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code#just-in-time-compilation) compiles IL to native code at runtime


---

### IL Tools
* Compiled assemblies can be inspected:
  - [**ILDasm**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/ildasm-tool): Non-graphical, built in
  - [**ILSpy**](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) or [dotnet IL tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/il-tools)
* Interesting to look at. 
* Good for learning.
* Rarely useful for runtime performance analysis.
