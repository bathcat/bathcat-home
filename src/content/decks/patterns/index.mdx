The Working with Design Patterns course delivers a hands-on view of how Design Patterns can be used to design and refactor software systems.  The course begins with a short overview of modern software design. From there youâ€™ll learn detailed implementation strategies for the primary construction patterns, with an eye to decoupling modules and creating testable units. At that point, the course explores modern strategies for data management, refactoring, and web services. The course will include examples in Java.

### Audience
Engineers with minimal design pattern experience looking for a deep dive into design choices and pattern implementations. 

### Purpose 
Promote an in-depth understanding of design and design patterns for software systems.
 
### Duration 
3 Days
