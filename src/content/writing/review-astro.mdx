This site used to be Vite's [React Pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages) plugin, which, honestly, was fine. But I switched to [Astro](https://astro.build/) recently, mostly because I wanted to explore another alternative to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## What's Astro?

From the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/):

> Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce. Astro is best known for pioneering a new frontend architecture to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to other frameworks.

Key points:

1. **Content-Driven**: Astro is tailored for content-rich websites, making it ideal for blogs, documentation sites, and marketing pages.
2. **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Astro outputs static HTML without relying on JavaScript unless explicitly required.
3. **Framework Agnostic (Sort of)**: Developers can integrate components from various UI frameworks such as
   React, Vue, Svelte, or others. However, native Astro components occupy a privileged position.

## Complaints

### Complaint #1: Yet Another HTML Template Syntax

Astro has its own template [syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/astro-syntax/) that's like JSX but not quite. So it's not a massive headacheâ€”just a minor annoyance.

Here's an example:

```astro title='Header.astro'
---
//This stuff runs on build
import Info from '../layouts/Info.astro';
import { PostInfoLink } from '../components/PostInfoLink';
import { Divider } from '../components/Divider';
import { getLivePosts } from '../content';

const posts = await getLivePosts();
---

<script>
  //This stuff runs on in the browser.
  console.log('Hello world!');
</script>

<Info title={'404: Page not found'} description={'Page not found'}>
  <p>Maybe you're looking for an article? Take a look below.</p>
  <div class='clear-both'>
    {posts.map(info => <PostInfoLink post={info} />)}
  </div>
</Info>
```

### Complaint #2: Islands are Segregated

An 'island' is a branch of the DOM tree that's treated differently from the 'ocean' of statically
rendered content.

From the docs:

> Think of a client island as an interactive widget floating in a sea of otherwise static,
> lightweight, server-rendered HTML. Server islands can be added for personalized or dynamic
> server-rendered elements, such as a logged in visitor's profile picture.

The distinction is important and not just for dynamic content. It's fine to use a React component
inside an Astro component, but not the other way around. Any React component in the DOM tree makes
a React-only branch.

So this works fine:

```astro title='Footer.astro'
---
// React component
import { CreativeCommonsLink } from './CreativeCommonsLink';
---
<div>
    <CreativeCommonsLink/>
    2020-2025 by Joe Bloggs
</div>
```

But once you're on the React island, you can't use Astro components. This doesn't work:

```tsx title='Body.tsx' {3}
import {Header} from './Header';
//Bork! React components can't consume Astro components.
import Footer from './Footer.astro';

export const Body = ({children})=>(
  <body>
    <Header/>
    {children}
    <Footer />
  </body>
);
```

Astro components are the ocean. Everything else is an island.

### Complaint #3: Different React Idiom

Even the React you write for Astro isn't quite the React you'd write for an SPA. If you're render
everything on the client, then it makes sense to render only what's really necessary. (This is a
general complaint about server-side generators, not Astro specifically.)

As an example, here's a somewhat naive `React.FC` component that decides what to render
based on the screen size of the client:

```tsx title='Header.tsx (SPA-flavored)'
export const Header = () => {
  const isWideScreen = useMediaQuery({
    query: '(min-width: 1224px)',
  });

  if (isWideScreen) {
    return <Navbar />;
  }

  return <MenuButton />;
};
```

But with an SSG like Astro, rendering is essentially free. You render everything and use styles
with media queries to show or hide appropriate components.

Something like this:

```tsx title='Header.tsx'
export const Header = () => (
    <><Navbar/><MenuButton/></>
);
```

```css title='global.css'
.bc-navbar {display: none;}
.bc-menu-button {display: block;}

@media (min-width: 1224px) {
  .bc-navbar {display: block;}
  .bc-menu-button {display: none;}
}
```

It's not the end of the world. But you can't expect to cut and paste jsx files and expect them
to just work.

Similarly, you can't expect 3rd party React components to just work. For example, [@iconify/react](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/react/).
I haven't looked at the implementation, but there's some kind of magic preventing it from being
rendered on statically. So making it look right takes a little work.

Alternatively, there is an Astro-native [Iconify integration](https://iconify.design/docs/usage/svg/astro/).
But that would be even _more_ work for me because, since it's an Astro component, it can't be used inside my React
header component.

Final example: sharing state. Separate React islands can't share state in the typical react
fashion. And it's sometimes difficult to avoid putting things in seperarate islands.
Lorem ipsum

Typical [reccomendation](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/#why-nano-stores)
is to share state with [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores). Which, again,
is fine. It works fine. But it's a slightly irritating.

...

### Good Part #1: Ecosystems

Astro has a lot of integrations with technologies you already use. Even the plugins have plugins.

So just this site uses:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) + [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) + [ReHype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype)
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)
- [Expressive Code](https://example.com)

All with minimal hassle.

### Good Part #2: Look and feel

Static pages usually require loading a entirely new page whereas SPA-style applications can
selectively render only the content that changes. To me, the SPA just feels better.

Astro can give you the best of both worlds with its [view transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-transitions/)
lending your statically-rendered content SPA-like user experience. The entire page doesn't seem to reload, and
components can keep state across page transitions.

### Good Part #3: Developer Experience

Astro Works out of the box with sensible defaults.

- **CLI tooling** makes it easy to add integrations.
- **Documentation** is actually good and helpful.
- **Simple routing** based on directories.
- **Performance** is practically free.

## Rating

import {Rating} from '../../components/Rating';

<Rating value='4' client:only/>

I guess my ideal SSG tool would be completely transparent. I would love to build a
content-heavy React SPA and have Astro magically render everything into static pages. But complete transparency isn't a
reasonable demand. Vite's [React Pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages) isn't transparent and
neither is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

Same with Astro. Effective use requires learning a little Astro.

So, overall, Astro is pretty good. It's simple, well-documented, and comes with lots of integrations. Pretty much what I needed.
